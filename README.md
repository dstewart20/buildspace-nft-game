# Buildspace NFT Game Project

This project uses images my favorite video game characters as NFTs that you can use to take out the Big Boss in a turn-based style of combat. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and task implementations.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
